<h1>Ska Radios of the world, unite!</h1>

When I started File Under Ska in 2003, livestreams were rare, but became increasingly prevalent.

Timezones (with daylight saving time and half-hour steps) are really tricky to implement.

To add your show, of if you find errors, send your details to matthias@file-under-ska.de.

If you are a <strike>nerd</strike> geek like me, create a merge request for <a href="https://github.com/mhaeusser/ska.one/blob/main/skaradios.html">https://github.com/mhaeusser/ska.one/blob/main/skaradios.html</a>.
